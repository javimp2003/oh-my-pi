# omp (custom) for VS Code

Chat with the [omp](https://github.com/javimp2003/oh-my-pi) coding agent from VS Code: a chat panel, a sessions list, model and thinking selection, and an editor for omp's settings. The extension runs your installed omp (`omp --mode rpc-ui`), so the agent, tools, skills, models, logins, and sessions are the same ones the terminal uses.

## Features

- **Chat** in the activity bar (π icon) or in an editor tab (`omp: Open Chat in Editor`, in the view's `…` menu), styled after the Codex extension: streamed answers with markdown and code blocks, collapsible thinking, an activity row per tool call ("Read …", "Edited … +3 −1"; shell commands as "Bash" and Python/JS as "Code", titled by the call's purpose with the command beneath) that expands to its arguments and output, and a queue for messages sent while omp works. The header has New chat, History, and Settings buttons; double-click the title (or its pencil) to rename the chat.
- **Timeline and pinned prompt** (as in Claude Code): each step of a turn (thinking, tool calls, the answer) hangs from a dot on a vertical line, green when a tool succeeded, red when it failed, pulsing amber while it runs, grey for thinking and text. Once your prompt scrolls out at the top, it stays pinned above the conversation (at the bottom of the chat, your latest prompt), with the composer below and the turn scrolling in between; click it to go back to the prompt.
- **Edit a prompt**: hover any of your messages and click its pencil to edit it in place and resend it. The last prompt simply runs again with the new text; an earlier one continues the session from that point after a confirmation, and everything after it leaves the conversation (it stays in the session file, reachable from the terminal's `/tree`). When omp changed files since that prompt, you can also restore them ("Edit and Restore Files"). Only turns in which the session edited files with its own file tools (edit, write, ast_edit, notebook, an applied LSP rename or code action) count: a session that only talked or ran commands never offers to restore, so another session's work is never touched. In the turns that count, omp's changes are reverted (commands run in them included), while changes you or other sessions made outside them are kept; files edited on the same lines by both are listed for you to pick. A notification offers to undo the restore.
- **File checkpoints** (behind the restore): when a prompt starts a turn, and when the turn ends, the extension snapshots every git repository of the workspace (also several repositories inside one folder). The prompt does not wait for its snapshot: it is taken while omp prepares the turn, and if a tool starts before it is done, that prompt keeps no checkpoint (it cannot restore files) rather than one that might already hold omp's changes; the log says so. Snapshots are git objects written through a temporary index, so branches, the index, staged changes and history are untouched. Git-ignored files (a venv, `node_modules`, build output), untracked files over 10 MB and files outside git repositories are not covered. Needs git on the PATH; turn it off with `ompCustom.fileCheckpoints`.
- **Composer**: `Enter` sends, `Shift+Enter` adds a line, `Esc` stops the reply. Typing `/` lists omp's slash commands and skills. Mention files with `@path`, or pick them with the `+` button; paste images (screenshots, copied pictures) to attach them. The footer has a brain button that expands or folds all thinking, a plan button that turns plan mode on and off (the agent plans read-only; its plan appears in the chat with Approve and execute / Refine plan buttons and Open in editor), the model and reasoning picker, and a context-window ring that opens usage, session cost, and Compact / Clean up / Handoff.
- **Word prediction**: while you type a word, omp's prediction (the terminal's ghost text, trained on your prompt history) shows how it ends in grey after the caret; `Tab` accepts it with a space, `→` without one, and typing on ignores it. omp's `spelling.autocomplete` setting picks the engine (`off` turns it off).
- **Voice input**: the microphone button in the composer (or `omp: Toggle Voice Input`, which you can bind to a key) records what you say; click it again to transcribe, `Esc` to drop the recording. The text goes in at the cursor, ready to edit and send. omp records the microphone itself (VS Code webviews cannot) and always transcribes through Groq's API (Whisper, `groq/whisper-large-v3-turbo`); no speech model is ever downloaded or run locally. The first time without a Groq key, the button offers to sign in with one (free tier, console.groq.com/keys). Set the spoken language in `ompCustom.voiceLanguage`. Needs omp v18.9.1-custom.15 or later.
- **Find in chat**: `Ctrl+F` (`⌘F` on macOS) while the chat has focus opens a find bar over the conversation, like a browser's (the extension's `omp: Find in Chat` keybinding takes the key from the code editor's find while the chat is focused): every match is highlighted, `Enter` / `Shift+Enter` (or `F3`, `⌘G`) move between them with a "3/12" count, and a match inside folded thinking or a tool row unfolds it. `Esc` closes it. While the History panel is open, the shortcut goes to its search box instead.
- **Chats without a workspace**: the globe `+` in the chat header opens a chat for general tasks (the network, the machine, scripts, documents, questions) that is not tied to the open project. omp runs it in its own folder (`ompCustom.noWorkspaceFolder`, default `~/omp-sin-workspace`, created on first use) instead of the workspace, so the project's file tree, `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` and memory stay out of it; your global omp setup (instructions, skills, model, settings) is the same. An `AGENTS.md` written in that folder on first use tells omp these chats are for general tasks; edit it to change that. The header shows "No workspace" on such a chat; files it writes without a path land in that folder; it takes no file checkpoints. Every window shares the same chats without a workspace. omp can still reach any path you give it: the chat is not confined to the folder.
- **History** (clock icon in the chat header): searchable list of chats, each with its first and latest prompt ("Only prompt" when it has a single one). Two tabs under the search box, **This workspace** and **No workspace**, each with how many chats match, show one group at a time; it opens on the open chat's group. Pick a chat to load it, rename it with its pencil, or delete it with its trash (after a confirmation, the session file and its artifacts move to the trash; a chat showing it starts a new session). A spinner marks sessions that are working, a green dot those that finished while you were elsewhere.
- **Sessions** view: every session of the workspace, newest first, titled automatically, with the same running/finished marks. Click to open; rename or delete from the item's buttons or context menu. `omp: Switch Session…` searches them.
- **Skills** view: every skill omp discovers, with its source; skills omp may correct on its own are marked "self-improving". Click a skill to open its `SKILL.md`. Each skill lists omp's self-improvement edits to it, newest first: click one to see its diff, or revert it with its inline button. When omp edits a skill after a task, the chat shows a "Skill updated" row with the summary, the diff and a Revert button.
- **Several sessions at once**: each session runs in its own omp process, so a turn keeps going while you open, start, or prompt other sessions; switching back shows it live. Processes of idle sessions you left stay warm for 10 minutes (up to 3), so going back is instant; leaving a session that is still working opens the next one in a new process ("Starting omp…").
- **Completion sound**: when omp finishes a task (in any session, shown or not), the machine running omp plays a short system sound, so you notice it while doing something else. Stopped or failed turns stay silent. It uses the OS's own player and sound (`afplay` on macOS, PowerShell's `SoundPlayer` on Windows, `paplay`/`canberra-gtk-play` on Linux). `ompCustom.completionSound`: `always` (default), `windowUnfocused` (only while you are in another app), or `off`.
- **Ask alert**: when omp asks you questions (`ask`) or waits for a plan approval, the machine running omp plays a short spoken recording (`media/ask-alert.mp3`), again every minute until you answer, so a question asked while you are in another app does not stall the session. It uses `afplay` on macOS, Windows Media Player through PowerShell on Windows, and `ffplay`/`mpg123`/`paplay` on Linux; when none can play it, the "omp (custom)" log says so. `ompCustom.askAlertSound`: `always` (default), `windowUnfocused`, or `off`.
- **Model and reasoning level**: the picker in the composer, or `omp: Select Model…` / `omp: Select Thinking Level…`.
- **Settings** (`omp: Settings`, gear icon): all omp settings by tab and group, with search, typed editors, and reset to default. Changes go through `omp config set`, so they apply to the terminal too.
- **Editor integration**: `omp: Add Selection to Chat` (`Cmd+Alt+K` / `Ctrl+Alt+K`, editor context menu) quotes the selection with its file and lines; `omp: Add File to Chat` (Explorer context menu) inserts an `@file` mention.
- **Dialogs**: questions from omp (`ask`), confirmations, and provider sign-in links open as native VS Code prompts.
- `omp: Log In to a Provider…` / `omp: Log Out of a Provider…`, `omp: Compact Context`, `omp: Open omp in Terminal`, `omp: Show Log`.

## Requirements

omp must be installed. By default the extension runs `omp` from your `PATH` (`omp.exe` on Windows). Otherwise set:

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ompCustom.executable` | Program to run: a full path to `omp`/`omp.exe`, or `bun` for a source checkout |
| `ompCustom.args` | Arguments before omp's flags, e.g. `["/path/to/oh-my-pi/packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts"]` with `bun` |
| `ompCustom.extraArgs` | Extra omp flags for the chat agent (`--model`, `--profile`, …) |
| `ompCustom.env` | Extra environment variables (proxy, certificates, API keys). omp already trusts the certificates of the OS store (the Windows certificate store, the macOS system keychain) and of the Netskope client, so a company network that re-signs HTTPS usually works without setup; `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` here replaces that with your own `.pem`, and `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED: "0"` turns certificate checks off as a last resort |
| `ompCustom.resumeLastSession` | Continue the workspace's latest session when the chat opens (default on) |
| `ompCustom.sendWhileBusy` | `steer` (deliver mid-turn, default) or `followUp` (queue until the turn ends) |
| `ompCustom.fileCheckpoints` | Snapshot the workspace's git repositories around each turn so editing a prompt can restore files (default on) |
| `ompCustom.voiceLanguage` | Language spoken to the microphone button (`es`, `en`, …); `auto` lets the speech model detect it (default) |
| `ompCustom.noWorkspaceFolder` | Folder that chats without a workspace run in (default `~/omp-sin-workspace`); their sessions, memory and files written without a path live there |
